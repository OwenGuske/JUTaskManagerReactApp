# JU Dolphins Task Manager

## Description
JU Dolphins Task Manager is a simple React application designed to help users manage tasks. Users can add tasks, view them in a list, and delete tasks as needed. The app is styled with a JU Dolphins-inspired green and gold theme.

As my time at **Jacksonville University (JU)** comes to an end as a **Finance Technology major**, this project reflects the coding and development skills I have gained this semester. Thanks to **Dr. Sinyagovskaya**, I have learned the fundamentals of programming and web development, including **HTML**, **JavaScript**, **CSS**, and **React**.
