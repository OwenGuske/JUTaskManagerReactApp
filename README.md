# JU Dolphins Task Manager Built Using React

## Description
JU Dolphins Task Manager is a React-based application that allows users to manage tasks. Users can add tasks, view them in a list, and delete them. The app features a green and gold theme inspired by Jacksonville University (JU).

This project reflects my growth as a Finance Technology major at JU, where I developed coding skills in **HTML**, **CSS**, **JavaScript**, and **React**. Special thanks to **Dr. Sinyagovskaya** for guiding me through these concepts this semester (Fall 2024).

## Features
- Add new tasks using the input field and "Add Task" button.
- View all tasks in a dynamic task list.
- Delete tasks using the "Delete" button next to each task.
- Styled with JU Dolphins colors (green and gold).

## What I Learned
This project allowed me to apply and strengthen my skills in:
- **React Fundamentals:** Creating functional components, managing state with `useState`, and handling user input.
- **Event Handling:** Implementing actions such as adding and deleting tasks through buttons and input fields.
- **Dynamic Rendering:** Using `map()` to render tasks dynamically.
- **Styling:** Combining inline styles with external CSS to build a visually appealing app.
- **Project Organization:** Structuring components and files for clarity and scalability.
